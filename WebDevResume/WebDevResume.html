              <p>
                I love to read, am inquisitive, cheerful, and enjoy learning.
                Growing up on a farm with an orchard of 200+ trees, a vineyard with 100+ grape plants, and a 150 by 50 foot garden taught me how to work early in my life.<br>  
              I earned my Eagle in 2019. I made 30+ fleece blankets and donated them to the Children's Justice Center
                 in Ephraim, Utah. If you have any weird questions or desire for facts, you may click on this link <a href="www.google.com"> Google Search Engine</a> to ask it and sate your desire for knowledge.

                  <h2>Education</h2>
                  <p> I was homeschooled through high school. I graduated High School in 2020 at the age of 17. 
                      I am currently enrolled in Snow College in the Software Engineering program. 
                      This is my second semester at Snow College, and my first semester in the Engineering Program.
                      I gained experience in my Web Development by creating this Resume that you are currently reading. I feel quite proud of my first attempt at this.
