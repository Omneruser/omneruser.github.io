              <p>
                I love to read, am inquisitive, cheerful, and enjoy learning.
                Growing up on a farm with an orchard of 200+ trees, a vineyard with 100+ grape plants, and a 150 by 50 foot garden taught me how to work early in my life.<br>  
              I earned my Eagle in 2019. I made 30+ fleece blankets and donated them to the Children's Justice Center
                 in Ephraim, Utah.

                  <p> I was homeschooled through high school. I graduated High School in 2020 at the age of 17.
